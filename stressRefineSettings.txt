stress_conversion conversion_factor conversion_string 
	(conversion of stress units from Pa to user units)
length_conversion conversion_factor conversion_string 
	(conversion of length units from m to user units)
outputF06 if this line is present, ascii stress results will be output in a nastran f06 file
needSoftSprings if this line is present, model is insufficiently constrained against
	rigid body motion and needs soft springs for stabilization
PMAX integer_value 
	max polynomial order to use in solution (default 8, max allowable 8, min allowable 2)
MAXITERATIONS integer_value
	maximum adaptive loop iterations (default 3, max allowable 10, min allowable 2)
uniformP if this line is present, the p order of all elements in the model
	is increased uniformly
ERRORTOLdouble_value
	Error tolerance for p-adaptivity (default 5%, min allowable 1%, max allowable 33%)
NOSACRIFICIAL if this line is present, identification and isolation of sacrificial elements
	at singularities will not be performed.
ALLCONSTRAINTSPENALTY if this line is present, all constraints will be processed via penalty method
	(default is only to process constraints in curvilinear coordinates on curved faces via
	penalty)
econSolve if this line is present, economy settings for adaptive solution are used
	as explained in the user's guide
